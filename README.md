## Where to Stay in Tokyo ~ Is Your Hotel REALLY Reasonably Priced ? ~

### Objective
To find reasonable hotels to stay in Tokyo by using a machine learning model

### Problem
* There are so many hotels in booking web services that it is difficult to choose actual one to stay.
* Also complicated filters and tags makes things worse in terms of searching reasonable venues.

### Resolving Scheme
1. Scraping a booking web service to get the dataset of hotels
2. Process the dataset
3. Create a ML model to predict the price of hotel
4. Use the model to see if hotel is reasonably priced
